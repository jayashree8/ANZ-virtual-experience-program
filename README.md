# Insidesherpa Virtual Internship 
# Data@ANZ

## This programme was divided into 2 tasks modules. A banking transaction dataset was provided which was common for both the tasks. The first task laid emphasis on Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the second task involved doing predictive analysis by creating a regression model.

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Segment the dataset and draw unique insights, including visualisation of the transaction volume and assessing the effect of any outliers.
